# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection
This project focuses on detecting fraudulent credit card transactions using Deep Learning techniques. Fraud detection is a  imbalanced classification problem, where fraudulent transactions are rare compared to genuine ones. The goal of this project is to maximize recall for fraud cases while maintaining a strong overall accuracy, ROC-AUC score.
